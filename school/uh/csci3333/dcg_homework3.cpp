/**
 * PROGRAMMER:          David C. Gibbons
 * COURSE:              CSCI 3333.01
 * DATE:                November 2, 2008
 * ASSIGNMENT:          Homework # 3
 * ENVIRONMENT:         Any ANSI C++ capable environment
 * FILES INCLUDED:      dcg_homework3.cpp
 * PURPOSE:             Perform basic link list operations.
 * ALGORITHM:           The following three basic list operations are
 *                      exercised (taken from the homework assignment doc):
 * 
 *                      Create list
 *                        The fist part of your program builds a list of 
 *                        your friendâ€™s information such as last name, 
 *                        first name, and telephone numbers.  Use a linked
 *                        list implementation.
 *
 *                      Retrieve list
 *                        The second part of your program displays the list
 *                        of information that you collected in the first 
 *                        part.
 *
 *                      Delete
 *                        The third part of your program deletes a record 
 *                        from the list and displays the remaining list.
