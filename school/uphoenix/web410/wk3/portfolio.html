                    The Apple I was Apple Computer&#39;s first effort in the nascent personal computer
                    industry. It was still very much a kit computer, but came more fully assembled than many
                    off its rivals. Only about 200 units were produced, but it set the stage for Apple's
                    next product...

                    The Apple II was one of the first personal computers and one of the most successful. It
                    propelled Apple Computer, Inc. to great success and set the stage for the future of the
                    company.

                    The Macintosh changed the world of computing when it was released. It was the first
                    mainstream to use a graphical user interface and began to change the way people
                    interacted and perceived personal computers.

                    The NeXTcube was the first product Steve Jobs helped develop after he left Apple Computer
                    in 1987. It was a high-end workstation, and was used in the development of technologies
                    such as the World Wide Web! The NeXTcube was innovative for its time, and included
                    technologies such as a Magneto-Optical Drive, built-in Ethernet, and Display Postscript.

                    The iMac was produced shortly after Steve Jobs' return to Apple Computer, Inc in 1997. The
                    iMac shared many of the characteristics of the original 1984 Macintosh in that it was an
                    all-in-one system design, but it also ushered in an era of focus on the physical design
                    aspects of computers and components that is still in place today.
