			<h1>Welcome to Chadwick's Fine Timepieces</h1>
			<h2>Your Premier Internet Horologist</h2>
			
			<p>
			Welcome to Chadwick's Fine Timepieces! We sell and service high-quality vintage timepieces.
			</p>
			
			<img class="inlineImage" src="4030_02b.jpg" alt="Another watch mechanism"/>
			<p>
			We sell timepieces that are rare, antique, or very unusual. We only sell a few products at a
			time in order to keep our standards and quality high. We also service all of the timepieces
			we sell for as long as you own them.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you are looking for a special timepiece that we do not currently show in our inventory,
			please <a href="contactus.html">contact us</a> and we will try and find what you are looking
			for. We have experienced horologists on staff that can usually locate the most rare or
			unusual timepieces out there!
			</p>
			<p>
			Why shop anywhere else?
