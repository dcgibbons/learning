Hamlet

One of the greatest stories ever written in the English language, Hamlet is the story of a 
young Danish prince who finds out from the ghost of his father (the king) that his uncle killed 
the king and married the queen. Filled with grief and the desire for revenge, Hamlet delays 
action. He is also in love with a courtier's daughter, Ophelia, but is so affected by his 
mother's treachery that he tells Ophelia to go to a nunnery and that he does not support 
marriage. He hires a theater troupe to stage a play that re-enacts the events of his father's 
death to study his uncle's reaction and determine his guilt; later events in the story surround 
attempts by the new king to have his nephew killed. Hamlet ends in tragedy but with the promise 
of immortality for Hamlet through his soldier's funeral and the recording of his story by his 
friend Horatio.
