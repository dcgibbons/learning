Modify the mortgage applet to be an application and to allow the user to input
the amount of a mortgage and then select from a menu of mortgage loans: 7 year
at 5.35%, 15 year at 5.50%, and 30 year at 5.75%.  Use an array for the
different loans.  Display the mortgage payment amount.  Then, list the loan
balance, amount of principle, and interest paid for each payment over the term
of the loan.  Allow the user to loop back and enter a new amount and make a new
selection, with resulting new values. Allow user to exit if running as an
application (can't do that for an applet though).

Note: I do not particularly care if the calculations are accurate from any
banking view. I am looking to see that you understand the Java programming
concepts discussed up to this point. Specifically, show me that you can create
a loop that will fill an area with a series of different (calculated) values.
Show me that you can create a reasonable GUI that allows me to choose from a
menu, input text, and see a series of up to 360 different results.

Note 2: I recommend that you not try to use JTable for the presentation of the
results.  That is a very complex Class that took me a month to get right the
first time (when I was teaching myself Java out of a textbook).  It still
gives me fits each time I set one up.  Choose some other Class for
presentation. (I certainly won't dock anyone that gets a JTable to work, but
that is far more complex approach than I expect anyone here to master.)
